C1008175_Contacts
===========================

How to use the program
----------------------
when entering names into the program be sure to enter them in lower case and search in lower case
when asked if you would like to edit the contact please enter answer in lower case as it is case sensitive
the same when asked if you would like to delete the contact

Usage
--------------------
1. To use the program press 1 to enter information then input details in the order that is asked
2. you can press 2 to view the contacts it will print out all the contacts currently saved in the database
3. You can press 3 to Search through the contacts list and find a contact that matches whatever detail you decieded to use to search whether that be name, address, birhtday, phone or phone number
4. while searching you will be given the option to edit or change

Assumptions
-------------------

* I am assuming that the user does not seperate their details with , as that is what the system is using to identify different details.
* I am assuming that the user does not exit the program mid way through adding details or changing as their progress is not saved
* I am assuming that the user answers the questions the system gives in lower case as it is case-sensitive
* I am assuming that if the user enters yes to delete the contact after pressing yes to edit it the delete will overide the yes even if the details are entered

User Case
------------------------
* when 3 is pressed you are given the search option
* type in what you want to search it is not case-sensitive
* you will be shown a matching contact
* if the contact does not match you will be asked to edit the contact say no and say on again when you are asked to delete and it will continue to search for the next matching contact
* if you want to edit the contact type "yes" it is case sensitive on contact and "no" on delete
* if you want to delete the contact press "yes" on delete and "no" on edit
* this will then delete the file that you have searched for
* then enter the new contact information in full as it will replace the old contact with the new one you are making 
* after this new updated contact will be saved into the file
